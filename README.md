## Description
Just as auto-hunting users are prevented in games and fraudulent listings in real estate, each platform needs to make efforts to minimize threats to each business. An unfair contractor is a representative of a company or company that is concerned about fair execution of the contract or the proper performance of the contract, or is otherwise inappropriate to participate in the tender. There are 18 reasons for unfair contractors, but the target of this project was companies classified as non-performance and non-execution of contracts.
