## Description
Just as auto-hunting users are prevented in games and fraudulent listings in real estate, each platform needs to make efforts to minimize threats to each business. An unfair contractor is a representative of a company or company that is concerned about fair execution of the contract or the proper performance of the contract, or is otherwise inappropriate to participate in the tender.
